# Cassandra storage extension for Keycloak

Uses Apache Cassandra to store and retrieve entities of all storage areas except authorization and events.
Requires Keycloak >= 26.7.0 (older versions may be supported by older versions of this extension).

## How to use

- Download the JAR from Maven Central: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/arbeitsagentur/opdt/keycloak-cassandra-extension/xxx/keycloak-cassandra-extension-xxx.jar
- Put the JAR in Keycloak's providers folder
- Select the cassandra datastore with `--spi-datastore--provider=cassandra` and enable the required preview feature with `--features=stateless`
- Set the necessary configuration options like cassandra endpoints (see the overview below)

> :warning: **Important information:**
Since map storage has been removed from Keycloak, using different storage providers for different storage areas (like users, roles) requires this extension to provide its own `DatastoreProvider`, which is selected as shown above. (The former `KC_COMMUNITY_DATASTORE_CASSANDRA_ENABLED` / `..._CACHE_ENABLED` env vars have been removed in favour of the datastore selection.)

### Storage areas

Which storage areas cassandra serves is controlled by `--spi-datastore--cassandra--areas` (default: `all`):

- `all` — every area; cassandra is the full datastore and no relational database is needed (the default).
- `cache` — only the dynamic areas (`user-session`, `auth-session`, `login-failure`, `single-use-object`, `revoked-token`); a relational database (JPA) serves the rest. This replaces the former "cache mode".
- an explicit comma-separated list of area names: `realm, client, client-scope, role, group, identity-provider, user, user-session, auth-session, login-failure, single-use-object, revoked-token`.

An explicit list also lets cassandra fill the areas another datastore extension does not serve. For example, paired with the [filestore extension](https://github.com/ba-itsys/keycloak-extension-filestore) (which serves the config areas — realms, clients, roles, groups — from files) while cassandra serves users and sessions:

```
--spi-datastore--provider=file
--spi-datastore--cassandra--areas=user,user-session,auth-session,login-failure,single-use-object,revoked-token
```

The filestore extension follows the same activation patterns (datastore selection, `stateless`, automatic cache disables), so the two compose: `file` is the selected datastore and serves its config areas, while its dynamic-area fall-through resolves to cassandra's providers for the areas listed above.

When `cassandra` is the selected datastore, this extension automatically disables the coherency-sensitive realm and authorization caches (unsafe under `stateless`), so you no longer need to set those by hand.

### Conditional storage areas (per realm)

`--spi-datastore--cassandra--conditional-areas` routes areas per realm instead of globally. Cassandra serves a conditional area only for realms that have the opt-in attribute of that area. All other realms keep the provider that would have been default without this extension (for example the filestore or JPA provider). Every area except `realm` itself can be conditional (`all` means every area except `realm`). An area cannot be listed in both `areas` and `conditional-areas`.

The opt-in is a realm attribute named `datastore<Area>Enabled` with the camel-cased area name (for example `datastoreClientEnabled`, `datastoreClientScopeEnabled`, `datastoreUserSessionEnabled`). Example: clients come from cassandra only for realms with `datastoreClientEnabled=true`. Users and sessions always come from cassandra.

```
--spi-datastore--provider=file
--spi-datastore--cassandra--areas=user,user-session,auth-session,login-failure,single-use-object,revoked-token
--spi-datastore--cassandra--conditional-areas=client
```

Notes and caveats:

- Every conditional area needs a fallback provider (another registered provider of the same SPI). The server fails at startup when there is none. The session-related areas (`user-session`, `auth-session`, `login-failure`, `single-use-object`, `revoked-token`) replace the embedded infinispan providers, so infinispan cannot be their fallback. These areas can only be conditional when another datastore extension serves them.
- Routing happens per call and uses the `RealmModel` argument of the called method. SPIs without realm arguments (`single-use-object`, `revoked-token`, `identity-provider`) use the session context realm. Calls with no resolvable realm stay on cassandra.
- The attribute only controls where new lookups and writes go. It does not migrate data. Entities created while the attribute was unset stay in the fallback store. They are no longer visible once the attribute is set. The same applies in the other direction.
- Realm import creates the default clients and roles before the imported realm attributes are applied. If an imported realm representation already contains the opt-in attribute, those defaults therefore end up in the fallback store. Create the realm first, then set the attribute, then create the entities of that area (or migrate existing entities before changing the attribute).

The following parameters might be needed in addition to the configuration options of this extension (see below):

## Deviations from standard storage providers

### Organizations

Keycloak Organizations are currently *not* supported and have to be turned off.

### User Lookup
Due to Cassandras query first nature, users can only be looked up by specific fields.
`UserProvider::searchForUserStream` supports the following subset of Keycloaks standard search attributes:
- `keycloak.session.realm.users.query.search` for a case insensitive username search
- `keycloak.session.realm.users.query.include_service_account` to include service accounts
- `email` for an email search

`UserProvider::searchForUserByUserAttributeStream` by default iterates all users in the entire database to filter for the requested attribute in-memory.
For efficient searches, attributes can be defined as **indexed attributes** by prefixing their name with **indexed.**, e.g. **indexed.businessKey**

### Conditional updates / optimistic locking
All write-queries are done conditionally via Cassandra Lightweight Transactions. Therefore we store a version column in each of the tables. To be able to use this to get notified if a conflicting change occured after data was read, the entityVersion is exposed via a **readonly attribute readonly.entityVersion**.
In order to pass a version in update operations, one can use the corresponding attribute **internal.entityVersion**.

### Uniqueness across username and password

This extension supports additional checks to prevent setting username to a value that is already as email of another user and setting email to a value used as username.

To enable these checks for a realm, set its attribute `enableCheckForDuplicatesAcrossUsernameAndEmail` to `true` (default when not set: `false`)

### Multi-Tab Refresh Token Rotation
This extension adds support for a grace period when checking for reuses. It can be set via `refreshTokenReuseInterval` realm attribute. Refresh token reuses during this grace period are allowed, which can be useful in case of retries / network problems.

### Unattended service account role assignment
Keycloak creates a service account user for each client with `serviceAccountEnabled` set to `true`.
This extension allows to dynamically assign roles to this service account. This needs to be enabled per role by setting an attribute `unattendedServiceAccountAssignment.enabled` to true.
It can further be restricted by setting the role attribute `unattendedServiceAccountAssignment.clientIdPattern` to a regex matching all client-ids where this role can be dynamically assigned.

To assign a role to a service account, a client attribute `initialServiceAccountRoles` needs to contain a comma-separated list of all role ids to set (which need to have the aforementioned attributes set).

### Private image registries

If you use a private image registry, you can use the .testcontainers file in your user directory to override all
image-registries used by the tests.
See https://www.testcontainers.org/features/image_name_substitution/

Example:

```properties
docker.client.strategy=org.testcontainers.dockerclient.EnvironmentAndSystemPropertyClientProviderStrategy
hub.image.name.prefix=private-registry/3rd-party/
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- **JDK**: See `pom.xml` for the required Java version.
- **Maven**: Used for building the project.
- **Docker**: Required for running integration tests via Testcontainers. A `docker-compose.yaml` is provided for a local setup including Cassandra.

### Checks (formatting and tests)

Run the following commands locally to ensure code quality:

- **Formatting**: `mvn spotless:apply` (Ensures consistent code style).
- **Verification**: `mvn verify` (Runs the full test suite and builds the project).

### Debugging

Debugging can be enabled via `mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug verify` (Port 5005).

### Using an external cassandra instance

If you want to use an external cassandra instance on localhost (Port 9042) you can
use `mvn -Dkeycloak.testsuite.start-cassandra-container=false verify`

## Conflicts with the JPA implementation (since 26.1)

The official Keycloak implementation now executes a `dependsOn()` for each provider. Even if it has a lower priority.
This will implicitly initialize the default JPA-Provider. 

To circumvent this problem you may want to define a "NullProvider" which overrides the default JPA-Provider.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Environment Not Found for Integration Tests

The Integration Tests require a container runtime.
If you encounter the error "Could not find a valid Docker environment", this typically occurs when:

1. Docker is not running
2. You're using Podman instead of Docker
3. The container socket is not accessible

**For Podman users:**
To run the tests with Podman, configure the Docker compatibility socket:

```shell
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/podman/podman.sock
mvn clean verify
```
